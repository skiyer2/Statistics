Suppose x and y are two continuous random variables such that x € [0,1] and y € [0,1] What is the probability of x+y <= 0.5?

Explanation:
x and y are continuous random vraibales and both can take values ranging from 0 to 1. Given this information, we should calculate P(x+y <= 0.5)

Let's put this understanding in a 2-d plane. Please check the below link which helps to visualize the above problem.

On x-y plane, the required probability P = Area of shaded Triangle/Area of Square = (1/2 * 0.5 * 0.5)/(1*1) = 0.125/1 = 0.125
