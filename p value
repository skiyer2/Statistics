#Explain p-value in layman terms

1. p-value refers to probability value of observing what we observed or extreme results if we assume our null hypothesis is true in an hypothesis testing.
2. Statisticians set a threshold called significance level (alpha), and in most cases this is taken to be 0.05.
3. If the p-value is less than the significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis and we call our results 
   statistically significant, as in they don't just occur by mere chance. Otherwise, we fail to reject null hypothesis.
